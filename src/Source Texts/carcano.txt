Oh you said the word “Carcano”? Allow me to explain how this incompetent glow-fest of a level is one of the worst and pathetic excuses for an extreme ever. Let’s start off with the deco. The deco is literally just 1.0 but the amount of glow used is wayyyy more than the amount of glow the actors in Twlight had. Did you not see how much they glowed???? Well Carcano glows way more and is the equivalent of stepping on a lego for your eyes. Now let’s talk about the song. You start off with the “tah-taahh-taAAHHHH” which is the dumbest sounding thing I have ever heard in my life and literally sounds squeakier and more annoying than I could ever sound. That’s just the predrop alone. Once you get to the drop, it doesn’t get any better. It has random notes that just feel like dragging on more than the Civil War and it’s so stupid and whoever listened to this and thought “yeah man this is fire” must’ve been braindead enough to hear something else that isn’t this garbage excuse of a song that Creo somehow made. How does the guy behind stuff like, Sphere, Dimension, and Never Make It make THIS pathetic, incompetent, useless piece of “music” that is just dragged out squeaky notes. Let’s talk about perhaps the worst part of the level, the gameplay. The gameplay is trying to make itself like Cognition but turns out the same way costume stores try to replicate movie characters’ costumes. It doesn’t work AT ALL. On top of all of this, every part has a several timings that just ruin the entire part and make it impossible to get consistent at literally any part of this garbage level. The gameplay makes me want to stick my head in the fridge since at least the cool air has better movements and sounds than the level will ever have and looks better. So my conclusion is that Carcano has eye-gouging deco, an ear-piercing song, and gameplay that wants to make an atheist walk to church to pray they don’t have to play this garbage, incompetent excuse of a “level”.
